## **What is a software developer?**
Software developers design, write, and test code for new systems and software to ensure efficiency. They create the foundations for operative systems and run diagnostic programs to certify effectiveness. They are employed in computer software, computer and video game development firms, information technology consulting firms, and in information technology units throughout both private and public sectors.

### **Typical Responsibilities**
+ Design, write, read, test, and correct code for new software
+ Analyze information to recommend and plan the installation of new systems or modifications of an existing system
+ Evaluate simple interrelationships between programs such as whether a contemplated change in one part of a program would cause unwanted results in a related part
+ Program animation software to predefined specifications for interactive video games, Internet and mobile applications
+ Write, modify, integrate and test software code for e-commerce, Internet and mobile applications
+ Develop, implement, modify and maintain gameplay features that integrate effectively into existing software
+ Write documentation for new and updated software.

### **Required Skills (technical and non-technical)**
+ Mathematical aptitude
+ Problem-solving skills
+ Programming languages (different types of developer roles require different languages)
+ Organisational and time management skills
+ Accuracy and attention to detail
+ Understanding of the latest trends and their role in a commercial environment
+ Communication and leadership skills
+ Analytical and critical thinking skills

## **Education**
Most software developer positions require at least a Bachelor's degree in computer science, software development or similar, but there are other routes to becoming a software developer through demonstrating enthusiasm and the capacity to learn new skills. Employers are sometimes willing to train younger employees.
