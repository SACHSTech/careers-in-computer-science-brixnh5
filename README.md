## **What is a software developer?**
Software developers design, write, and test code for new systems and software to ensure efficiency. They create the foundations for operative systems and run diagnostic programs to certify effectiveness. They are employed in computer software, computer and video game development firms, information technology consulting firms, and in information technology units throughout both private and public sectors. Their salaries can range from around $50,000 to $125,000.

### **Typical Responsibilities**
+ Design, write, read, test, and correct code for new software
+ Analyze information to recommend and plan the installation of new systems or modifications of an existing system
+ Evaluate simple interrelationships between programs such as whether a contemplated change in one part of a program would cause unwanted results in a related part
+ Program animation software to predefined specifications for interactive video games, Internet and mobile applications
+ Write, modify, integrate and test software code for e-commerce, Internet and mobile applications
+ Develop, implement, modify and maintain gameplay features that integrate effectively into existing software
+ Write documentation for new and updated software.

### **Required Skills (technical)**
+ Mathematical aptitude
+ Programming languages (different types of developer roles require different languages)
+ Understanding of the latest trends and role

### **Required Skills (non-technical)**
+ Problem-solving skills
+ Organisational and time management skills
+ Accuracy and attention to detail
+ Communication and leadership skills
+ Analytical and critical thinking skills


## **Education**
Most software developer positions require at least a Bachelor's degree in computer science, software development or similar, but there are other routes to becoming a software developer through demonstrating enthusiasm and the capacity to learn new skills. Employers are sometimes willing to train younger employees.

## **Experiential Learning**
Experiential learning opporunities are a great way to gain unique, hands-on experience in industries outside of the classroom, allowing students to apply their learning in the real world. Many employers look for this experience in their employees.

Some experiential learning opportunities include:
+ Co-op programs
+ Interships
+ Shadowships/Aprenticeships
+ Undergraduate Research
+ Community service
+ Studying abroad
+ Personal projects

At Waterloo, computer science students have access to a variety of co-op, studying abroad and undergraduate research opportunities.

### **Co-op Program Example**
As a co-op student at Waterloo, students will normally alternate between four months in school and four months as a full-time employee of the organization they are working for.

Alternating school and co-op terms allows students to explore multiple career paths and types of employers to suit their interests, as well as applying what they have learned in school

### **Getting hired**
+ Review job postings from employers Waterloo has recruited and choose which ones students want to apply to.
+ Employers select students to interview, based on résumés, work experience, and perhaps academic record.
+ If you're selected for an interview, you'll meet with the employer in person or online.
+ After the interview, you rank the employers and they rank interviewees based on preference.

### **Sample Co-op Job Titles**
+ Tools and automation engineering intern
+ Data scientist
+ Mobile developer
+ Software developer
+ iOS developer
+ Production engineering
+ Algorithms engineering
